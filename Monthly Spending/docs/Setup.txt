			Account1.xlsx
			Account2.xlsx
			Account3.xlsx
		2019 Spending.xlsx (file to hold the monthly spending data by category and sub-category)
	2020
		Source Files
			Combined.xlsx
			Account1.xlsx
			Account2.xlsx
			Account3.xlsx
		2020 Spending.xlsx (file to hold the monthly spending data by category and sub-category)
		
Create an Excel file and save it as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook to hold the form and macro files and name it whatever you like. I named mine Monthly Spending.

Open the file and select the Developer tab. If the Developer tab is not enabled, follow the instructions in the following link
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45

Once you have selected the Developer tab, click on the Visual Basic button on the left side of the ribbon or press Alt-F11 to open the Visual Basic editor.

In the Visual Basic editor, right click on the VBAProject(Monthly Spending.xlsm). This is the macro file you opened the Visual Basic editor from.

Select Import File... This will open an Import File dialog window to select the files you downloaded from my GitHub repository.

You can only pick one at a time so select each file untill you have imported all of them.

These files are frmMain.frm, modCommon.bas, modFormEvents.bas, modInitWorkbook.bas, modReports.bas.

Right click on the ThisWorkbook item at the bottom of the listed files anc select View Code. This will open the edit window for this item.

Open the downloaded file ThisWorkbook.txt and copy the contents. Paste the code into the ThisWorkbook code editor.

Click the Save button in Excel to save the macros to the workbook.

Close the Visual Basic editor window.

Close the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook you created, save the file if the Save dialog box appears.

To run the application, open the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook you created and the Monthly Spending Report form will appear centered on the workbook.
