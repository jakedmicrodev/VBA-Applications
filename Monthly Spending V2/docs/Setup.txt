Setup Monthly Spending V2 Application

I created the following folder and file structure for this application
Budget
	2019
		Source Files
			Combined.xlsx
			Account1.xlsx
			Account2.xlsx
			Account3.xlsx
		2019 Spending.xlsx (file to hold the monthly spending data by category and sub-category)
	2020
		Source Files
			Combined.xlsx
			Account1.xlsx
			Account2.xlsx
			Account3.xlsx
		2020 Spending.xlsx (file to hold the monthly spending data by category and sub-category)
		
Create an Excel file and save it as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook to hold the form and macro files and name it whatever you like. I named mine Monthly Spending.

Open the file and select the Developer tab. If the Developer tab is not enabled, follow the instructions in the following link
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45

Once you have selected the Developer tab, click on the Visual Basic button on the left side of the ribbon or press Alt-F11 to open the Visual Basic editor.

In the Visual Basic editor, right click on the VBAProject(Monthly Spending.xlsm). This is the macro file you opened the Visual Basic editor from.

Select Import File... This will open an Import File dialog window to select the files you downloaded from my GitHub repository.

You can only pick one at a time so select each file untill you have imported all of them.

These files are:
	ErrorHandling.bas
	frmMain.frm
	frmMain.frx
	modArrayFunctions.bas
	modCommon.bas
	modFormEvents.bas
	modInitWorkbook.bas
	modUpdatess.bas.
	StringFunctions.bas
	
Right click on the ThisWorkbook item at the bottom of the listed files anc select View Code. This will open the edit window for this item.

Open the downloaded file ThisWorkbook.txt and copy the contents. Paste the code into the ThisWorkbook code editor.

Click the Save button in Excel to save the macros to the workbook.

Close the Visual Basic editor window.

In this workbook, create 6 worksheets. These worksheets are used by the application to initialize the Monthly Spending workbook that holds your spending data.
	Accounts
		The list of accounts you are getting your spending data from.
	Groups
		What the data is grouped by in the downloaded CSV file. These names can be changed to your local language but they must also be changed in the Worksheets entries.
	Heading Ends
		The heading name in A1 and N1 for each of the account worksheets. These names can be changed to your local language.
	Months
		The abbreviated names of the months. These names can be changed to your local language.
	Queries
		The SQL queries used by ADO to select the data from the Excel account files.
	Worksheets

In the Accounts worksheet, enter the following items in column A
	A1 Account
	A2 The name of one of your accounts
	A3 - A... The names of each of the other accunts
	In the last cell enter Combined for the combined accounts if there is any
	
In the Groups worksheet, enter the following items in column A
	A1 Groups
	A2 Sub Category
	A3 Category
	
In the Heading Ends worksheet, enter the following items in column A
	A1 A1 and N1
	A2 Category
	A3 Total
	
In the Months worksheet, enter the following items in column A

	A2 Feb
	...
	A12 Dec
	
In the Queries worksheet, enter the following items in columns A and B
	A1 QueryName
	B1 Query
	A2 Category
	B2 SELECT [Master Category] FROM [Spending$] GROUP BY [Master Category]
	A3 Sub Category	
	B3 SELECT [SubCategory] FROM [Spending$] GROUP BY [SubCategory]
	A4 Temp Category
	B4 SELECT [Master Category], Sum([Amount]) FROM [Spending$] WHERE [Date] Between #%1# And #%2# GROUP BY [Master Category]
	A5 Temp Sub Category
	B5 SELECT [SubCategory], Sum([Amount]) FROM [Spending$] WHERE [Date] Between #%1# And #%2# GROUP BY [SubCategory]
	A6 Join Category
	B6 SELECT cl.[Category], t.[Amount] FROM [List - Category$] AS cl LEFT JOIN [Temp$] AS t ON cl.[Category] = t.[Category]
	A7 Join Sub Category
	B7 SELECT cl.[Category], t.[Amount] FROM [List - Sub Category$] AS cl LEFT JOIN [Temp$] AS t ON cl.[Category] = t.[Category]

In the Worksheets worksheet, enter the following items in column A
	A1 Worksheet
	A2 Temp
	A3 List - Sub Category
	A4 List - Category
	A5 Account3 - Sub Category (Change Account3 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A6 Account2 - Sub Category (Change Account2 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A7 Account1 - Sub Category (Change Account1 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A8 Combined - Sub Category
	A9 Account3 - Category (Change Account3 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A10 Account2 - Category (Change Account2 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A11 Account1 - Category (Change Account1 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A12 Combined - Category

	If you only have one checking account with a debit card associated with it, that is your Account1 entry. Therefore you would have
	A1 Worksheet
	A2 Temp
	A3 List - Sub Category
	A4 List - Category
	A5 Account1 - Sub Category (Change Account3 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
	A6 Account1 - Category (Change Account1 name to whatever you saved the downloaded renamed account CSV to Excel file)
		
Close the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook you created, save the file if the Save dialog box appears.

To run the application, open the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook you created and the Monthly Spending Report form will appear centered on the workbook.
